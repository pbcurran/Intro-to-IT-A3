    <h1>Project Aim</h1>
    <p>Provide users the knowledge and skills to independently source and construct computer parts; we have consciously
        chosen the words in this statement to explain the crucial points in our aims moving forward. We want to give our
        users the skills and knowledge to do this repeatedly and not just on a one off occasion. We want to be able to
        offer the users the opportunity to source the parts and we want them to be able to construct the PC
        independently without outside help.
    </p>
    <h2>project goals</h2>
    <p>Construct a parts compatibility database that tells the user if the parts that they have selected will both fit
        and work together. The database will need to be easy to understand and efficient to use as we expect to have
        users that are inexperienced in the field of technology. Having a dedicated database for this information will
        mean that we will be able to work this information easier and access it for the users when needed.
        Have an easy to understand instructional process that caters to different groups. This will mean we will need to
        create avenues for people to follow instructions in different ways. Examples of this would be both videos that
        show and explain processes and also have alternatives such as text documents and pictures that show the process.
        This will be essential to the accessibility of the site and ties in well with the core aim of having the users
        being able to use the site independently.
        Give users the resources to source the parts that they are searching or choosing from our website. This will
        require many outside links to websites such as Amazon or Pc Case Gear. If there are parts that we cannot source
        through official websites alternative avenues may need to be suggested or alternatives parts may need to be
        suggested. This goal will be beneficial for the long term viability of the product because users will be able to
        use it as an end to end product for the selection and sourcing of their computer parts.
    </p>



    <h1>Roles</h1>
    <p>Throughout this project we had decided that Paul, is in charged in uploading our text in Github as shows more
        skills in HTML and CSS he will be in charged on uploading all the team members information as well as uploading
        content discussed within the group members. Whilst the rest of the team will work as project managers discussing
        on what other information we will need to collect in to help our users understand better on how to built their
        own PC. After that all team members will work together so that we can discuss regarding future plan and also
        progress and develop our project plan. Technically, we are all project managers however we are not able to code
        our own web therefore we have to hire a professional web developer to complete our website. Furthermore, since
        we have 5 group members conflicts on ideas may occur therefore we came out with a system to vote yes or no for
        any ideas.
    </p>

    <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
    <p>By the end of the 14 weeks we want to have design concepts for each of the major pages of the website done, these
        may just be done in wireframes for functionality at this stage but we would want to have definitive concept
        design for the pages to be done at this stage. The pages need not have any full functionality at this stage but
        the design should be almost finalised.
        For this project we anticipate that the largest undertaking will be the integration of all the software
        elements. For example having someone put in parts and then website correctly identifying that they are
        compatible with each other. For the timeframe that we have the goal by the end of the 14 weeks we want to be
        able to put in parts into some sort of prototype search interface and have it correctly display if the parts
        entered are compatible with each other. If we can get the database interfacing parts of the project working
        accurately the only remaining part of this area would be the scalability of this technology, this could be a
        major milestone to achieve after the 14 weeks have taken place.
        At this stage we would not expect full functionality of the compatibility database to be ready by the end of the
        14 weeks however a proof of concept where we can show the functionality with simple examples would be expected
        to have been finished at this stage as explained above.
        We would also want examples of instructional text documents and videos that show users how to build computers
        out of parts; this would be done with simple parts and simple computer builds as a proof of concept for the
        instructional segment of our project. This goal would also closely relate beta testing where we have
        inexperienced users follow these guides to get information on the efficacy.

    </p>

    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
    <p>For this project the tools and technologies needed can be split into two main categories: hardware and software
        Hardware: For this project we will need a complete build of compatible PC parts that we can use to complete
        initial instructional video and text walkthroughs. Example of compatible hardware parts could be as follows:
        Graphics card: ASUS GeForce GTX 1070 Dual Fan OC 8GB
        CPU Cooler: Silent Loop 240mm Liquid CPU Cooler
        ASUS GeForce GTX 1070 Dual Fan OC 8GB
        Case: NZXT H440 Mid Tower Case White/Black
        CPU: Intel Core i7 7700
        Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B250F Gaming Motherboard
        PowerSupply: Thermaltake 750W Toughpower Gold
        RAM: Corsair Vengeance LED CMU16GX4M2C3000C15 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4
        Hard Drive: Seagate Barracuda 2TB

        Software: A wide range of software would be needed for this project as it has a lot of components needed for the
        different software design areas. A good solution to the web design area at least to start with would be
        something like the service offered by wordpress which gives the user the ability to quickly and simply create
        websites with a wide range of flexibility, this requires a relatively cheap subscription so would also be cost
        effective, for preliminary designs a software like Adobe Dreamweaver could be good for this which requires a
        yearly subscription as well so may only be needed if we find during the project we require it. For design of the
        database LucidChart can be used for showcasing diagrams and structures of databases which is an important part
        for increasing the efficiency and reducing the redundancy of the database. Further along in the timeline we can
        use SQLite for testing and building of the database during the alpha and beta testing phases of the project; the
        benefit to each of these products is that they are free, lucid chart has a cost associated with additional
        features but SQlite is in the public domain which is an added bonus for reducing costs. Any coding that needs to
        be done would be best done in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code; this is a widely used code editor that is also
        free to reduce costs. Paul has experience with writing code in Visual Studio Code for software development
        purposes and has designed basic databases using LucidChart and SQLite, this previous experience will be
        beneficial especially in the early stages of our project to potentially lower the learning curve for members
        with less experience.

    </p>

    <h1>Testing</h1>
    <p> Integration Testing/ Functional testing - This will be performed to make sure that the database of our
        compatible
        computer parts will be integrated properly into our website. A milestone for successful testing in integration
        here would be successfully getting any kind of result from our database; However successful functional testing
        would involve the website correctly displaying compatible parts that are relevant to the searched parts by the
        tester. This would involve heavy alpha testing prior to any beta testing as the user would not be able to
        accurately provide feedback on the back end workings of the service that would be required for useful testing
        feedback.

        End To End Testing - Beta testing here will be a heavy focus as we need applicable feedback about how the users
        are navigating our website or application from start to finish. We will need new outside users as prior
        experience with the product would affect the results about accessibility and ease of use. For the early stages
        of our plan here approximately 10 user testing cases would be ideal as this would allow for a more wide variety
        of use cases. These users would ideally be an audience that does not have extensive computer building
        experience, for this reason younger audiences such as high school students could potentially be a good starting
        point, a younger audience would likely have enough technology experience to increase testing efficiency while
        still offering enough lack of experience to make their feedback useful. Successful testing here would be users
        being able to efficiently use the application without any outside assistance from our internal team.

        Unit Testing - This would be almost exclusively performed by our internal team and would involve things like
        debugging, multiprocessing and optimization of our code. This testing will need to be heavily performed at the
        beginning of the project to try and increase the efficiency of the project later on in the time frame. Tests
        like this could also be automated simply running a large number of the same class/ method functionality of the
        code.

            <td>In the very beginning of
                this project, we had looked
                at the feedback from
                assignment 2 as a group
                and discussed our marks
                and adjusted our project
                idea accordingly. Our
                feedback suggested that
                that there is a large number
                of existing suppliers for the
                parts that our users will be
                building computers out of.
                Therefore, Paul suggested
                the idea of having a
                database that combines the
                different types of products
                that are compatible into one
                easily understandable
                category. This will
                eliminate the issue of
                having different suppliers
                and brands which could
                have confused our website

                split the sections of the
                project into even parts. Due
                to the project idea
                originating with Paul, he
                agreed to be in charge of the
                Product Description and
                Overview. It was also
                decided that Allan would

            <td>This time of the assignment was
                used to branch off and complete

                throughout our group would
                continue through Microsoft
                Teams in case any of the

                needed resolving. Due to this
                time being an extremely busy
                period for most people during
                uni, time management is

                most of our challenges.
                Unfortunately, two out of five
                group members did not
                contribute or submit their
                parts of the assignment. This

                they had to complete their
                parts on their behalf in haste.
                This was disappointing as it

                finished, with just finishing
                touches being made or final
                testing for functionality and
                security being completed.
                The specific outcome for
                week 10 is to finalise any last
                minute details in order to
                perfect the finished project.
                The end product should be an
                incredibly informative
                website that can be
                understood by any kind of
                audience. The website should
                be safe, well designed and
                easy to navigate on any
                device or platform.
