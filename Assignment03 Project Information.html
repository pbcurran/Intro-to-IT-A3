    <h1>Project Description</h1>

    <h2>What does it do?</h2>

    <p>The basic feature of the service will be to enter the computer parts that the user has purchased and then give
        the user instructions on how to build the pc based on the parts that they have purchased. For starters the user
        may need to enter what kind of case they have purchased; as most cases have generic set ups for the shape that
        they come in the user can be given a pre-made template for a case that fits the design of their case most. For
        example if they have a standard size case over a mini case they can be shown pictures and videos that have been
        made with this size case in mind. Attaching the different parts of the computer in the correct order can be
        shown keeping in mind the parts they previously entered. An important part of the pc build is making sure that
        the correct cables are connected to the correct ports on parts such as the motherboard, this would be an
        integral part of the service ensuring the user has the instruction on how to properly set up the connections
        within their PC. As most connections inside a PC are similar even with the numerous parts available on the
        market this could be achieved by making videos that can be applied to more than one parts configuration without
        having to have the specific parts the user has entered; an important part of the instructions would be making
        clear any small differences that may occur due to parts variations.
        An aspect of the service that will need to be taken into account due to feedback gained from our previous
        submission will be the fact that there is a large number of suppliers for the parts that our users will be
        building computers out of. One of the ways we will mitigate the inconvenience of this is having a database that
        combines the different types of products that are compatible with each other into one simple to understand
        category, for example a there are many different brands of M.2 solid states drives(SSD) and there are also many
        different brands of SATA cable SSDs. However M.2 SSDs use the same connection onto the motherboard meaning that
        we can categorize M.2 SSDs from different suppliers and different brands together. We can also use this strategy
        for something like motherboards that have an M.2 slot in them, this allows the user to easily see the
        compatibility of motherboards with M.2 type SSDs. This strategy can be translated to different computer parts to
        allow us to mitigate the problems that having different suppliers and brands will cause for our service.
        The State of the art in this area of technology would be the website PC Part Picker, this website offers a
        number of the features that have been described above. With the databasing and web design implemented into this
        website there is a large list of pc parts which they allow to check the compatibility of. They also offered
        featured builds by trusted users and premade PC builds where they try to cater to specific needs.
        With technology in 3D modelling and augmented reality rapidly becoming more available and user friendly what can
        be done in the future with this kind of project could be allowing users to enter parts and then having augmented
        reality devices actually show the user how to build their computers with their actual computer parts in their
        hands in real time, Future Of 3D Modelling: 5 Upcoming Technological Trends. Increased development in the field
        of artificial intelligence(AI) could also provide users with more specific PC builds that match the users needs
        more accurately than generic builds that are designed with a one size fits all strategy; some of the
        developments in the area of predictive analytics could apply to these design needs, AI for Predictive Analytics:
        Everything You Need to Know.

    <h2>What is the likely impact</h2>
    <p>If the project is successful it would make it easier for a younger or less experienced audience to start from
        scratch and build a PC, this would solve the problem of the higher barrier to entry for purchasing and building
        your own PC. Over the last 15 years the number of people who have access to a computer worldwide has almost
        doubled from 27.3% and 49.7%. Even with the current barrier of entry being relatively high the dramatic increase
        rate would likely only increase if the inexperienced audience worldwide were given an easy and effective way of
        allowing them further access to the platform.
        PC gaming is currently the slowest growing major form of gaming behind for example consoles which saw a 10% year
        on year growth compared to PCs 4.5% (The Global Games Market Will Generate $152.1 Billion in 2019 as the US
        Overtakes China as the Biggest Market). The reasons for this slower growth is unclear but one of the main
        speculations is the barrier to entry in terms of accessibility being much higher than console. A service like
        this could drastically increase the growth of PC gaming in the general public and show strong signs in potential
        growth areas such as this.
        An increase in this kind of market growth would create jobs in a wide variety of areas from manufacturing and
        design of PC parts to the development of new video games. A shift in the market could potentially cause the
        migration of some jobs from for example the manufacturing of console gaming related industries to a more PC
        focused industry.

    <h2>How will this affect you</h2>
    <p>For most of our group members this will not likely have a large effect on the way we interact with technology or
        live our day to day lives, as we are not the intended audience for this kind of product or service not a lot
        will change for us, however understanding this will be crucial for the development of our project in phases such
        as user testing.
        For members of our friend group or family a project like this could offer many benefits to them. Using this
        product would allow them to easily and effectively choose and build their own PCs without any outside help. With
        proper descriptions on our builds it also has the potential to save them money as sourcing and building your own
        parts is cheaper than buying pre made computers from stores.
        The overall effect of a service such as this would be allowing the people in our friend and family group to
        become more familiar with technology which could lead to more understanding of the process and eliminate any
        preconceived notions of difficulty or accessibility.

    <h1>Project Overview</h1>

    <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>For our project we plan to design and develop a website that gives users information and instructions on picking
        and constructing computer parts into their own computers. We will need to create a plan that includes a
        timeframe and roles for each of our team members. We hope to further develop our understanding of information
        technology projects by undertaking this.
        A project like this could create a new audience for computer use by lowering the barrier to entry and has the
        potential to create new target markets for information technology fields from PC gaming to software design.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>The motivation for this project is to give a less experienced audience the means to create their own computer
        while also learning valuable long term skills and information within the technology space. With the PC market
        growing our project fits in well with these trends and could show prospective employers that we are forward
        thinking and are aware of different target audiences and have good skills with project planning
    </p>

    <h2>Landscape</h2>
    <p>A main competitor in this space would be the web site PC Part Picker, they offer a similar service where they
        show the compatibility of different computer parts for you and confirm that they will work with each other. One
        differentiating factor for our project would be the specificity of our recommendations and instructions.
