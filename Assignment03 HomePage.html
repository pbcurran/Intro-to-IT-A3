    <h1>Team personal imformation</h1>

    <p>S3637423 - Nicholas Low Khai Yang likes to take part in video games, basketball and swimming in his spare time.
        His interest in IT was sparked by wanting to
        know how hacking and coding works and also editing photos. Nicholas wants to pursue a career in software
        engineering in the future and chose to attend RMIT
        Melbourne for the location and the prestige that comes with RMIT university.</p>
    <p>S3807389 - Allan Liem Became interested in IT mainly due to video games and esports, he was also influenced by
        his uncle who owned computer and console
        modification business that helped with his interest in IT. He has experience working in a computer hardware
        warehouse called Scorptec which has shown him the
        wide variety of needs that consumers need for electronics and computer hardware. In his spare time he enjoys
        playing games such as CS:GO and playing soccer.
        In the future he would like to develop a career in the area of Esports event planning.</p>
    <p>S1111111 - Adele Di Lisio was born in Melbourne and has an Italian background; she is studying bachelor of
        applied science(psychology)
        and enjoys reading and playing video games in her spare time. Although Adele doesn't have a lot of experience in
        the area of IT she
        wants to be able to further her experience and knowledge in the area as she can see how important the different
        areas of IT will be in the world
        moving forward.</p>
    <p>S3303005 - Paul Curran grew up in Ireland in his early years and then moved to Australia when he was around 9
        years old. Building computers and playing video
        games is what first got him interested in computers, in his spare time he likes to play drums and video games.
        He doesn't have a lot of professional experience
        in the area of IT however he wants to garner this by utilizing the facilities that RMIT offers. In the future he
        would like to pursue a job as a full stack
        developer as it seems like it would be a varied career that he would enjoy.</p>


    <h1>Group Processes</h1>
    <p>Assignment 2 presented some challenges for our group, most of these challenges were presented to us by the
        unexpectedness of remote group participation due the situation caused by COVID-19. Despite these challenges we
        think we worked well together, one of our group members failed to submit any work for our assignment but we
        still managed to put together a complete website by having deadlines set by our group members as a contingency
        for this situation; using this strategy we were able to have enough time to provide some content for the missing
        group member. Learning from this hurdle we plan to have more communication in the weeks leading up to the due
        date to avoid last minute problems like this.
        Our communication using Microsoft teams was effective throughout the last assignment so we will continue to use
        this as our primary method of communication and file sharing.
    </p>

    <h1>Career Plans</h1>
    <p>Some of the teamâ€™s ideal jobs are quite similar with Paul, Nicholas and Victoria choosing either a full stack
        developer or a software engineer. These jobs are likely to entail a lot of similar responsibilities such as
        skills in software design, user centered design and programming. Some things that could differentiate these
        positions could be Victoria's desire to enter a more web developer focus area whereas Paul's was more related to
        application development which could lead to a different requirement in a programming language such as PHP vs
        Java.
        Allan's ideal job was more focused on event planning around something like Esports which is quite different from
        others ideal jobs in the group. Even though it is a very different area than for example software engineering,
        some skills could still be transferable between the two areas such as team planning and project management.
        Careers paths throughout the group could be quite similar between for example a full stack developer and a
        software engineer, however they also have potential to be very different between our ideal jobs. An Esports
        event planner career path would likely look very different to
